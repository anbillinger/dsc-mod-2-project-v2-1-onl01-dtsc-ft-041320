# Module 2 Final Project
By Alex Billinger
With Blake Samaha

## Purpose
* Create a model for housing prices from King County data set
* Present information on model for a non-technical audience

## Key notebooks in this repository
* student: contains code for cleaning data and EDA
* interactive_predictor: runs interactive demo for making prediction on new data
* zipcode_analysis: contains EDA for zip code influence on prices
* Validation: contains code and plots for determining how well model predicts data
* Zip code plots: creating plots to show that zip code is a good simplified model for data

## Other important files
* Presentation.pdf: pdf of slideshow used for presentation
* Presentation_video: video of presentation (if file doesn't work, link is https://github.com/anbillinger/dsc-mod-2-project-v2-1-onl01-dtsc-ft-041320)
* predict_house_price_interactive.py: python file for code used in interactive_predictor
* kc_county_multilinreg.sav: saved linear regression model used for prediction

## Datasets (other than original)
* kc_house_data_cleaned: data after replacing null values and dropping unnecessary columns
* linreg_ready_data: preprocessed data (transformed continuous values and one-hot coded categorical values)
